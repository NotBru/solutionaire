\textbf{Excercise 2.1: }Is it possible to find a general formula for $p(C|A+B)$, analogous to $(2-48)$, from the product and sum rules? If so, derive it; if not, explain why this cannot be done.

\textbf{Answer:}

Sure. We've derived Bayes theorem without naming it, which is simply product rule and commutativity, so we can say
\begin{align*}
	p(C|A+B)&=\frac{p(C)\,p(A+B|C)}{p(A+B)}\\
	&=\frac{p(C)\,\left(p(A)+p(B)-p(AB|C)\right)}{p(A)+p(B)-p(AB)}.
\end{align*}

\textbf{Excercise 2.2: }Now suppose we have a set of propositions $\{A_1,\,\cdots,\,A_n\}$ which on information $X$ are mutually exclusive: $p(A_iA_j|X)=p(A_i|X)\delta_{ij}$. Show that $p(C|(A_1+A_2+\cdots+A_n)X)$ is a weighted average of the separate plausibilities $p(C|A_iX)$:
\begin{align*}
	p(C|(A_1+\cdots+A_n)X)=p(C|A_1X+A_2X+\cdots+A_nX)=\frac{\sum_ip(A_i|X)p(C|A_iX)}{\sum_ip(A_i|X)}.
\end{align*}

\textbf{Answer:}
For $i\neq j$,
\begin{align*}
	p(C|A+B)&=\frac{p(A+B|C)p(C)}{p(A+B)}\\
	&=\frac{(p(A)+p(B)-p(AB|C))p(C)}{p(A)+p(B)-p(AB|C)}.
\end{align*}
Iterating this over $\sum_iA_i$ we get
\begin{align*}
	p\left(\sum_iA_i\middle|X\right)&=\sum_ip(A_i|X).
\end{align*}

Thus, and in a similar manner to the above excercise,
\begin{align*}
	p\left(C\middle|\sum_iA_iX\right)&=\frac{p\left(\sum_iA_i\middle|CX\right)p(C|X)}{p(\sum_iA_i|X)}\\
	&=\frac{\sum_ip(A_i|CX)p(C|X)}{\sum_ip(A_i|X)}\\
	&=\frac{\sum_ip(A_i|X)p(C|A_iX)}{\sum_ip(A_i|X)}.
\end{align*}

\textbf{Excercise: }Let $A_i$ mutually exclusive ($P(A_iA_j)=P(A_i)\delta_{ij}$). Then, $P(\sum_iA_i)=\sum_iP(A_i)$.

\textbf{Answer: }

If $i\in\{1,\,2\}$, then
\begin{align}
	P(\sum_iA_i)&=P(A_1+A_2)\\
	&=P(A_1)+P(A_2)-\cancelto0{P(A_1A_2)}\\
	&=\sum_iP(A_i).
\end{align}

Then, by induction,
\begin{align}
	P\left(\sum_i^{N+1}A_i\right)&=P\left(\sum_i^NA_i\right)+P(A_{N+1})-P\left(\sum_i^NA_iA_{N+1}\right)\\
	&=\sum_i^NP(A_i)+P(A_{N+1})-\sum_i^N\cancelto0{(A_iA_{N+1})}\\
	&=\sum_iP(A_i).
\end{align}

\textbf{Excercise 2.3: Limits on Probability Values: } As soon as we have the numerical values $a=P(A|C)$ and $b=P(B|C)$, the product and sum rules place some limits on the possible numerical values for their conjunction and disjuncion. Supposing that $a\leq b$, show that the probability of the conjunction cannot exceed that of the least possible proposition: $0\leq P(AB|C)\leq a$, and the probability of the disjunction cannot be less than that of the most probable proposition: $b\leq P(A+B|C)\leq 1$. Then show that, if $a+b>1$, there is a stronger inequality for the conjunction; and if $a+b<1$ there is a stronger one for the disjunction. These necessary general inequalities are helpful in detecting errors in calculations.

\textbf{Answer: }

For the conjunction,
\begin{align}
	P(AB|C)&=P(A|C)P(B|AC)\\
	&=aP(B|AC)
	&\leq a.
\end{align}

Since $P(AB|C)=b+a-P(A+B|C)$, if $b+a>1$ then $P(AB|C)>1-P(A+B|C)=P(\overline{A+B}|C)$.

For the disjunction,
\begin{align}
	P(A+B|C)&=P(A|C)+P(B|C)-P(AB|C)\\
	&=b+a-P(AB|C)\\
	&\geq b.
\end{align}

And also, $b+a<1$ implies $P(A+B|C)<1-P(AB|C)=P(\overline{AB}|C)$.

\textbf{Excercise 3.1: }Why isn't the multiplicity factor $(3-16)$ just $n!$? After all, we started this discussion by stipulating that the balls, in addition to having colors, also carry labels $(1\cdots N)$, so that different permutations of the red balls among themselves, which give the $r!$ in the denominator of $(3-16)$, are distinguishable arrangements.

\textbf{Answer: }

We've decomposed the event ``drawing $r$ red balls in $n$ draws'' as the union of events of the form ``draw $r$ red balls in $n$ draws with the particular permutation of orders $p$'' for permutations $p$, which are mutually exclusive and identically plausible. At doing this, we're using the events $R_i$ and $W_i$, with the probability given by $(3-14)$. If we were to use ``drawing the following $n$ balls, where $r$ are red'', we should be accounting for the probability $B_{ij}$ of drawing the $i$th ball after $j$ draws, which would incorporate the missing factors.

\textbf{Excercise 3.2: Probability of a Full Set: }Suppose an urn contains $N=\sum_iN_i$ balls, $N_1$ of color $1$, $N_2$ of color $2$, $\cdots$, $N_k$ of color $k$. We draw $m$ balls without replacement; what is the probability that we have at least one of each color? Supposing $k=5$, all $N_i=10$, how many do we need to draw in order to have at least $90\%$ probability of getting a full set?

\textbf{Answer: }

We're asked $P\left(\sum_{r\in I}\prod_ir_i\right)$, where $I=\{(r_i):\,r_i\geq1\forall i\}$. We can decompose this as 
\begin{align}
	P\left(\sum_{r\in I}\prod_ir_i|B\right)&=\sum_{r\in I}P\left(r_1\cdots r_k|B\right)\\
	&=\frac1{\begin{pmatrix}N\\m\end{pmatrix}}\sum_{r\in I}\prod_i\begin{pmatrix}N_i\\r_i\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

A calculation is probably better done by calculating the missing terms instead, which are those for which at least one of those are $0$, of which there are less, since at least one of the summands is already $0$, the rest varying between the same intervals.

The ``3.2.py'' script does the maths, and outputs $m=15$ as the solution, with a probability of about $0.91$.

\textbf{Excercise 3.3: Reasoning Backwards: }Suppose that in the previous exercise $k$ is initially unknown, but we know that the urn contains exactly $50$ balls. Drawing out $20$ of them, we find $3$ different colors; now what do we know about $k$? We know from deductive reasoning (i.e., with certainty) that $3\leq k\leq 33$; but can you set narrower limits $k_1\leq k\leq k_2$ within which it is highly likely to be?

\textbf{Answer:}

I suppose this is the first use case of Bayes theorem as it's usually used. By letting the hypotheses $H_k=\text{``There are $k$ different colors in the urn''}$ and the data $D=\text{``3 different colors have been seen after 20 draws''}$, we want $P(H_k|D)$, but what our model tells us with certainty is $P(D|H_k)$, so we'll use Bayes' theorem for this:
\begin{align}
	P(H_k|D)&=\frac{P(D|H_k)P(H_k)}{\sum_kP(D|H_k)P(H_k)}.
\end{align}
I will assume each $H_k$ is equally likely, since I've got no information on anything. Thus,
\begin{align}
	P(H_k|D)&=\frac{P(D|H_k)}{\sum_kP(D|H_k)}.
\end{align}

We're now left with the task of finding the probability that $3$ different colors are seen in a set of $20$ taken from $50$, given there are $k$ different colors. To this end, we split $D=\sum_NDH_N$, where $N\in\mathbb N^k$ is such that $N_i$ is the number of balls with the $i$th color, and get
\begin{align}
	P(D|H_k)&=P\left(\sum_NDH_N\middle|H_k\right)\\
	&=\sum_NP(DH_N|H_k)\\
	&=\sum_NP(D|H_NH_k)P(H_N|H_k).
\end{align}
We once again propose an homogeneous distribution over the $N$, which gives $P(H_N|H_k)=\begin{pmatrix}50-k\\k-1\end{pmatrix}^{-1}$.

Now, let's think of the probability of drawing from only the colors $1$, $2$, and $3$ in all draws. For the $m$th draw, the probability is
\begin{align}
	\frac{51-m-\sum_{l=3}^{k-2}N_l}{51-m}&=\frac{51-m-N_\text{rem}}{51-m},
\end{align}
so for the 20 draws, we get
\begin{align}
	\frac{\left(50-N_\text{rem}\right)!\;30!}{\left(30-N_\text{rem}\right)!\;50!}.
\end{align}

So, the chances of drawing only the first $3$ colors are the sum over all of the $N$ of this term. For each choice of $N_\text{rem}$, there are $\begin{pmatrix}47-N_\text{rem}\\2\end{pmatrix}=(47-N_\text{rem})(46-N_\text{rem})$ such terms. And, by simmetry of label permutation, for each choice of $3$ colors the result is the same, so finally, by splitting $D$ into the sum of ``drawing only for these $3$ particular colors'', we sum over these $k!/(k-3)!$ choices, and get our final result:
\begin{align}
	P(D|H_k)&=\frac{k!}{(k-3)!}\sum_{N_\text{rem}=k-3}^{47}(47-N_\text{rem})(46-N_\text{rem})\frac{(50-N_\text{rem})!\;30!}{(30-N_\text{rem})!\;50!}\begin{pmatrix}50-k\\k-1\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
\end{align}

The ``3.3.py'' script implements this solution, giving the probability distribution shown in Figure \ref{fig:3.3}
\begin{figure}[h]

\textbf{Exercise 3.4: Matching: }The $M$ urns are now numbered $1$ to $M$, and $M$ balls, also numbered $1$ to $M$, are thrown into them, one in each urn. If the numbers of a ball and its urn are the same, we have a match. Show that the probability of at least one match is
\begin{align*}
	P&=\sum_{k=1}^M(-1)^{k+1}/k!.
\end{align*}

As $M\rightarrow\infty$, this converges to $1-1/e=0.632$. The result is surprising to many, because however large $M$ is, there remains an appreciable probability of no match at all.

\textbf{Answer:}

Indeed, it surprises me. But, we're throwing infinite uniquely labeled balls to infinite uniquely labeled urns. It's no surprise it doesn't help a lot. It's also surprising that the probability lowers when going from odd $k$ to even $k$. The proposition $\mathcal M=\text{``There is at least one match''}$ can be decomposed as the sum of $\mathcal M_i=\text{``There is a match in urn $i$''}$, so
\begin{align}
	P(\mathcal M)&=P\left(\sum_{i=1}^M\mathcal M_i\right)\\
	&=P(\mathcal M_1)+P\left(\sum_{i=2}^M\mathcal M_i\right)-P\left(\mathcal M_1\sum_{i=2}^M\mathcal M_i\right)\\
	&=\cdots\\
	&=\sum_{i=1}^MP(\mathcal M_i)-\sum_{k=2}^MP\left(\mathcal M_{k-1}\sum_{i=k}^M\mathcal M_i\right)\\
	&=\sum_{i=1}^MP(\mathcal M_i)-\sum_{k=2}^MP(\mathcal M_{k-1})P\left(\sum_{i=k}^M\mathcal M_i\middle|\mathcal M_{k-1}\right).
\end{align}

Now, since the set of propositions $\mathcal B_{n,\,i}=\text{``The ball $n$ falls into the urn $i$''}$ is exhaustive, mutually exclusive, and symmetrical for every $i$, we have $P(\mathcal B_{n,\,i})=1/M$. By observing that $\mathcal M_i=\mathcal B_{i,\,i}$, we see $P(\mathcal M_i)=1/M$, so that
\begin{align}
	P(\mathcal M)&=1-\frac1M\sum_{k=2}^MP\left(\sum_{i=k}^M\mathcal M_i\middle|\mathcal M_{k-1}\right)\\
	&=1-\frac1M
\end{align}

The proposition $\mathcal M=\text{``There is at least one match''}$ is the negation of $\mathcal N=\text{``There is no match at all''}$, which in turn can be decomposed as the product of propositions $\mathcal N_i=\text{``There is no match on box $i$''}$. In terms of this negation, the exercise takes the form $P(\mathcal N)=\sum_{k=2}^M(-1)^{k+1}/k!$.

In these terms,
\begin{align}
	P(\mathcal N)&=P\left(\prod_{i=1}^M\mathcal N_i\right)\\
	&=P(\mathcal N_1)P\left(\prod_{i=2}^M\mathcal N_i\middle|\mathcal N_1\right).
\end{align}

We can see that the propositions $\mathcal B_{i,\,j}=\text{``Ball $i$ goes to urn $j$''}$ for fixed $j$ are exhaustive and equally likely, so that $P(\mathcal B_{i,\,j})=M$, and so $P(\mathcal N_1)=P\left(\sum_{i=2}^M\mathcal B_{i,\,1}\right)=(1-1/M)$. We keep on,
\begin{align}
	P(\mathcal N)&=P(\mathcal N_1)P\left(\prod_{i=2}^M\mathcal N_i\middle|\mathcal N_1\right)\\
	&=(1-1/M)P(\mathcal N_2|\mathcal N_1)\left(\prod_{i=3}^M\mathcal N_i\middle|\mathcal N_1\mathcal N_2\right).
\end{align}
Now, since by symmetry $P(\mathcal N_2|\mathcal N_1)=P(\mathcal N_1|\mathcal N_2)$
